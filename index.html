            <h3>Post-2020 lifestyle and Interests</h3>
            <p>The whole world came to a standstill with the outbreak of an outrageous virus, Coronavirus Disease, aka
                Covid-19. People went into lockdown, enclosing themselves under a single roof, for an unknown period of
                time. Phrases, like work-from-home and online classes, started going viral and became the new normal.
                The
                contagion of technology spread apace with the virus. Now, students are attending classes virtually
                sitting
                at home, lying on their beds, or in any other comfortable position. Who wouldnâ€™t have wanted that as a
                student?</p>

            <h1>Dreams don't work out if you don't</h1>
            <h2>Life before the New-Normal</h2>
            <p>In pre-lockdown times, students had to greet the day early before heading out for school or university.
                However, presently educational institutes reside just a click away, simultaneously requiring no proper
                attire for attendance. Who knew the fantasy of every student would someday come true? Students can spend
                endless time with their families and focus on their non-work-related interests, like every day is a
                holiday.</p>
