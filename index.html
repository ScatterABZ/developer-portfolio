            <h3>Post-2020 lifestyle and Interests</h3>
            <p>The whole world came to a standstill with the outbreak of an outrageous virus, Coronavirus Disease, aka
                Covid-19. People went into lockdown, enclosing themselves under a single roof, for an unknown period of
                time. Phrases, like work-from-home and online classes, started going viral and became the new normal.
                The
                contagion of technology spread apace with the virus. Now, students are attending classes virtually
                sitting
                at home, lying on their beds, or in any other comfortable position. Who wouldnâ€™t have wanted that as a
                student?</p>
